This game is a fresh, modern spin on the classic strategy game, Gomoku. Itâ€™s all about placing stones on a board and racing to connect five in a rowâ€”whether itâ€™s across, down, or diagonally. Easy to pick up, but with endless room for strategy, LineGrinder is perfect for quick matches with friends or testing your skills solo.

With LineGrinder, you get:

A clean, simple interface thatâ€™s easy to use.
Customizable board sizes, so you can play short or epic battles.
A Java-based GUI using Swing for smooth, responsive gameplay.
A codebase thatâ€™s beginner-friendly and easy to expandâ€”whether you want to add AI opponents, tweak game rules, or build new features.
Dive in, have fun, and grind those lines to victory! Feel free to fork the repo, explore the code, and put your own spin on it. Have fun!
