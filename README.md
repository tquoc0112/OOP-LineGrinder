Welcome to LineGrinder! ðŸŽ®

This game is a fresh, modern spin on the classic strategy game, Gomoku. Itâ€™s all about placing stones on a board and racing to connect five in a rowâ€”whether itâ€™s across, down, or diagonally. Easy to pick up, but with endless room for strategy, LineGrinder is perfect for quick matches with friends or testing your skills solo.

With LineGrinder, you get:

A clean, simple interface thatâ€™s easy to use.
Customizable board sizes, so you can play short or epic battles.
A Java-based GUI using Swing for smooth, responsive gameplay.
Dive in, have fun, and grind those lines to victory! Have fun!
